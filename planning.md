# Planning.md

## Step 1.
Uses npx create-react-app, on the topic not of user experience but of *development; to contribute, other developers should have a good code editor like VSCode, iTerm, and be familiar with installing Git on macOS via Xcode Command Line Tools.  The great thing about Create React App is that for the sake of *code hygiene it performs npm install dependencies.  We can host on localhost :)!  After heroku auth:whoami, does heroku create, and puts task.md in root folder.

Adds question addition problem, input box, and refactors functional component to class component for *responsiveness.  Includes mouseDown function with this binding, which allows *proper documentation for the existence of the mouseDown function.  * -> *, - -> -, / -> %2F, . -> ., space -> %20, ^ -> %5E, = -> %3D, [ -> %5B, is retrieved by encodeURIComponent(`{expression}`).

While using the link types noopener, the keyword for the rel attribute of the a href element, which instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it, using noreferrer in order not to provide the Referer HTTP header, with target = "_blank" to open in a new tab, refactors the existing Create React App code so that the math question rotates by using the className App-logo as its container div, which really helps with the user experience; users prefer *responsive, non-interfering designs which animate what matters.

## Step 2.
Let's add more to this planning.md documentation.  Instead of using event listeners and the DOM, integrates swal with method chaining within which the axios GET request is made per the axios docs, which does error catching and handling to submit and return messages from the api.mathjs.org API, instead of modifying DOM elements when events' listeners are triggered on them, uses axios.get method chaining to handle server response in a .then/.catch/.then block which works with the promised response, and by the way the user and the soon-to-be event handler will work with user input!

Installs React Bootstrap to include React Bootstrap and Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button', styling button with type=submit to follow React Bootstrap guidelines, modeling button after react-bootstrap.github.io/components/buttons.  e.preventDefault is on the componentDidMount turned into async onSubmit(e) {... for which there's an event handler written in JSX!

Optimizes submit flexbox for mobile view @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {... and fancifies button with moving CSS background, displays previous user input and API responses from Math.js with the setResponseData helper function transferred from _this_.  Includes non-typing equality check!  ::placeholder is colored:).  Every element of the styling is superbly done.
